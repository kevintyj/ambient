**[Live Demo](https://ambient-rvx.web.app/)**

This tool is designed to generate **contrast ready** color pallets built specifically for UIUX design. Unlike other palette generation tools, Ambient generates the colors **based on the primary color**. Hues, saturation, and relative lightness adjustments are made automatically using our algorithm. As ambient relies on the primary color for alternative color generation, primary colors **must be contrast compliant**. Ambient displays both WACG and APCA definitions of text contrast, 4.5:1(WACG) or 60Lc(APCA) is recommended for text contrast. 

#### Limitations

The current contrast ratios are based on 4.5:1 and 60 for recommended contrast between text and background. When designing for accessibility in mind,  **text sizes should also be considered**. Ambient does not give any recommendation for text sizes, the official WCAG documentation should be referred to generate a lookup tables for text and background combination for text sizes.

Ambient was built with [Solid Start](https://solidjs.com)
